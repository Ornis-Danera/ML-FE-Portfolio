## Overview
This mini project explores the behavior of currency portfolios derived from Principal Component Analysis (PCA).  
Rather than interpreting PCA factors as market signals or hedging strategies, the focus here is on testing how persistent the top-performing principal components are across consecutive quarters.

By comparing the portfolios associated with the highest-returning components from one quarter to the next, this analysis provides insight into how quickly the structure of currency returns evolves over time â€” revealing whether strong components remain stable or rotate rapidly with changing market conditions.
